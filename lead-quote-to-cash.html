                    &#128162; **Problem:** The organization faced significant integration breakdowns within its end-to-end Lead-to-Cash process. This was primarily due to disparate legacy and NextGen systems, leading to data inconsistencies, manual workarounds, and delays in sales and revenue operations.

                    <li>Working closely with development teams to ensure **SQL scripts** were designed to clean, transform, and accurately migrate data to the new integrated system.</li>
                    <li>Supporting and overseeing **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** to validate that the integrated process met business requirements and stakeholder expectations.</li>

                        My primary contribution was bridging the gap between business needs and technical execution in this complex integration project. I ensured that every data point and process step in the Lead-to-Cash journey was accounted for, from initial lead capture to final revenue recognition. This involved a deep dive into both current state inefficiencies and desired future state capabilities, translating business objectives into technical specifications that guided development.
