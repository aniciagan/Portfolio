                    &#128162; Problem: After a significant system upgrade or migration to a NextGen platform, a critical challenge emerged: ensuring seamless and accurate consumption of the new data by essential downstream applications. Any discrepancies could lead to operational disruptions and incorrect reporting.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    &#128161; Solution: I played a key role in ensuring data integrity and usability post-migration through the following efforts:

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4 space-y-2 mb-6">
                    <li>Developed an SQL-based data quality dashboard specifically designed for post-migration health monitoring. This dashboard provided real-time visibility into data accuracy, consistency, and completeness, allowing for quick identification and resolution of any issues.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated with data engineers and source system owners to understand the nuances of data transformation and integration.</li>
                    <li>Documented the new data consumption and processing workflows in a detailed Functional Requirements Document (FRD). This FRD served as a crucial guide for technical teams and provided a clear understanding of how downstream systems would interact with the migrated data.</li>
                    <li>Conducted thorough data validation checks and worked with QA teams to design and execute tests specifically for data integrity.</li>
                    <li>Provided support for data reconciliation and troubleshooting, ensuring all critical applications were functioning correctly with the new data.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        In this migration project, my focus was on the critical "last mile" of data quality and usability. By building the SQL-based dashboard and meticulously documenting the new data processes in the FRD, I enabled proactive monitoring and ensured that business users and downstream systems could confidently rely on the newly migrated data. This significantly reduced post-migration issues and fostered trust in the new system's data integrity.
